        <h2>THUNDERBOLTS (2025)</h2>

        <p>
          <b>How it fits in the MCU: </b>Beyond the possibility of Zemo (Daniel
          Brühl) secretly organizing an Avengers all his own, the notion of a
          Thunderbolts in the MCU seems tailor-made to explain the appearances
          and behavior of the Contessa. Also: will they be called upon to truly
          replace the Avengers when Doom (or some other Thanos-level antagonist)
          finally makes good on their threat? Considering the film calendar
          Feige revealed in 2022, we have to wonder if the Thunderbolts will
          utterly fail, forcing a new Avengers to form. Or, perhaps, Kamala
          Khan’s (Iman Vellani) younger group…

        <h2>AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY (2026)</h2>
        <img

        />
        <p>
          <b>How it fits in the MCU: </b>Presumably, Downey’s Doom hails from an
          alternate Earth — maybe even the same one as the Fantastic Four — but
          how could such a Doom become aware of the Multiverse and the tapestry
          Loki (Tom Hiddleston) now maintains? Will he have to face off against
          the God of Stories first? Or does their shared love of the color green
          indicate something else?

        <h2>AVENGERS: SECRET WARS (2027)</h2>

          alt="avengers secret wars"
        />
        <p>
          <b>How it fits in the MCU: </b>No matter what Doom does in the two
          Avengers films, we expect the MCU will look fairly different
          afterward. Oh, and the post-credit scene — if one happens — would be
          the perfect moment to reprise the X-Men animated series theme again.
          Also, the original Secret Wars comics introduced Spider-Man’s black
          suit, so maybe that piece of Venom left in the MCU will make its way
          to Peter…
