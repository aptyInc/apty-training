        This scene takes place in Season 5, Episode 8 of Game of Thrones, titled
        "Hardhome." Jon Snow, now Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, addresses
        a group of Free Folk (wildlings) at Hardhome, a remote settlement in the
        far north. The wildlings are a group of people who live beyond the Wall,
        and they are often in conflict with the Night's Watch and the people of
        the Seven Kingdoms. In this pivotal scene, Jon Snow delivers a
        passionate and stirring speech to rally the Free Folk to unite with the
        Night's Watch in the face of the White Walkers and the army of the dead.
