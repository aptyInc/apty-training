00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.849
We said we'd fight with you,
King Qrow, when the time

1
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.339
comes, and we meant it.

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.299
But this isn't
what we agreed to.

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.959
These aren't White Walkers.

4
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.619
This isn't an
army of the dead.

5
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.019
This isn't our fight.

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.239
If it weren't for him,
none of us would be here.

7
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.298
All of you would be meat in
the Night King's army and

8
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.849
I'd be a pile of charred
bones just like Mance.

9
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.509
Remember Mance's camp?

10
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.549
It stretched all the
way to the horizon.

11
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.369
And look at us now.

12
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.548
Look what's left of us.

13
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.189
And if we lose
this, we're gone.

14
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.349
Dozens of tribes.

15
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.349
Hundreds of generations.

16
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.929
Be like we were
never there at all.

17
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.129
We'll be the last
of the free folk.

18
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.609
That's what'll happen
to you if we lose.

19
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.519
The Boltons, the
Karstarks, the Umbers,

20
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.049
they know you're here.

21
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.839
They know that more than
half of you are women and

22
00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.999
children, and they know that.
