                <h3>Implementation of digital filter using verilog HDL</h3>
                <p> In the context of Very Large Scale Integration technology, where addition is essential, digital filters are essential 
                    elements. The performance of the Finite Impulse Response Filter is highly dependent on the speed of its multiplier unit, making 
                    it stand out among the others. In order to improve the effectiveness of the FIR filter, we suggest using a Wallace tree multiplier. 
                    This novel method offers improvements over conventional multipliers, with a decrease in latency being one of the main 
                    advantages. Significant improvements in latency are obtained by using Xilinx tools and implementing this filter design in 
                    Verilog HDL. The Wallace tree multiplier is perfect for FIR filter construction in low-voltage and low-power VLSI applications 
                    since it has benefits like higher operating frequency and reduced power consumption. This development might improve the 
                    effectiveness and performance of digital filters, especially in settings with limited resources, opening the way for more robust 
                    VLSI systems. </p>
