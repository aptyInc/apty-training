  <p>
    Hey! I'm someone who really enjoys <span class="red">eating out</span> and trying new food places especially with friends.
    I love <span class="blue">watching movies</span> and just chilling on weekends.
    Making new <span class="green">friends</span> and talking for hours is something I never get tired of.
    I'm also into <span class="purple">tech stuff</span> like coding and building small projects, but I always make time for
    <span class="red">fun</span>, whether that's a quick trip or just <span class="blue">binge-watching shows</span> at home.
  </p>
