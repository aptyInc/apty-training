    <h1>The Lost Puppy</h1>
    <p>
One sunny morning, <span style="color: #B388E8;">Lily</span> was walking through the <span style="color: #228B22;">forest</span> when she heard a <span style="color: #FFA07A;">soft whimper</span>.
Curious, she followed the sound and found a <span style="color:#F5DEB3 ;">tiny puppy</span>, <span style="color: #87CEEB;">shivering</span> under a bush.

The puppy had <span style="color: #B2BEB5;">no collar</span> and looked <span style="color: #FF7518;"> hungry</span> and <span style="color: #C72C48;">scared</span>. Lily gently <span style="color: #FFD700;">picked him up</span> and whispered,
"Don’t worry, I’ll take care of you."

She took him home, gave him <span style="color: #FFFDD0;">warm milk</span> and a <span style="color: #FADADD;">soft blanket</span>, and named him <span style="color: #00BFFF;">"Buddy"</span>"Buddy".
From that day on, Lily and Buddy became the <span style="color: #FF0000;">best of friends</span>.
