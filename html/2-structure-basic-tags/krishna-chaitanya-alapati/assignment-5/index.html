    <h2>A Short story</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="intro">Once upon a time,</span> in a cozy little
      <span class="forest">forest</span>, lived a clever rabbit named
      <span class="rosie">Rosie</span>. She loved to hop and play, but she was
      also known for her quick wit and problem-solving skills. One
      <span class="sunny-span">sunny morning</span>, while exploring near the
      <span class="river">river</span>, Rosie noticed a group of squirrels
      struggling to reach a <span class="nuts">pile of nuts</span> on a high
      branch. The nuts were too far up, and the squirrels couldn't jump high
      enough to get them. <span class="rosie">Rosie</span>, seeing their
      dilemma, had an idea. She quickly gathered some long, sturdy vines and
      tied them together, creating a rope. Then, she carefully climbed a nearby
      <span class="tree">tree</span> and tossed the rope down to the squirrels.
      With Rosie's help, the squirrels were able to pull themselves up to the
      branch and enjoy the <span class="nuts">delicious nuts</span>. The
      squirrels were overjoyed and thanked <span class="rosie">Rosie</span> for
      her cleverness and kindness. From that day on,
      <span class="rosie">Rosie</span> became known as the
      <span class="rabbit">"Helper Rabbit"</span> of the forest, always ready to
      lend a paw or a vine to those in need.
