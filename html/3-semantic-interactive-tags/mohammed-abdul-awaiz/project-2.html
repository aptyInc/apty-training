          <h2>What is a blog?</h2>
          <p>
            A blog is an online platform or website where individuals or
            businesses regularly publish written long-form content, known as
            posts, on various topics. Blogs can be personal, like a digital
            diary or professional, focusing on areas such as technology,
            fashion, travel or health. They often include various types of
            multimedia like images and videos and traditionally encouraged
            reader engagement through comments - the advance of social media has
            killed this part of blogs for the most part. Blogs serve as a way to
            share information, express opinions, and connect with a broader
            audience.

          <p>
            The benefits of blogging are numerous. They're a great way to build
            a brand around a business and to generate traffic to your website.
            From a blog readers can be encouraged to explore the rest of a site,
            or to take action from a CTA. Blogs can be used to promote product
            launches and company news, or they can be used combined with SEO to
            generate traffic and customers.
