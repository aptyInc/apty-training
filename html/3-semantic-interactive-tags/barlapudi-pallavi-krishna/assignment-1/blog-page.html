                        <h2>Ooty</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>My recent escape to <strong>Ooty</strong> was everything I hoped for and more. Located in the Nilgiri Hills of Tamil Nadu, Ooty greeted me with cool breezes, lush tea gardens, and that sweet smell of eucalyptus in the air. After months of hustle, this peaceful hill station felt like a dream.</li>
                            <li>Pack appropriately for varying temperatures, be mindful of driving conditions on hilly terrain, and respect the local environment by avoiding plastic and littering</li>

                            <li>After years of exploring mountains and cities, I finally decided to chase waves — and <strong>Lakshadweep</strong> was the perfect escape. Located in the Arabian Sea, these coral islands offer some of India’s most serene and untouched beaches.</li>
