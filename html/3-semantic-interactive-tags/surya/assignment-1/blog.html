                <h2>Roadbook</h2>
                <p>What I love about it: Roadbook is my new favorite travel blog this year. It combines excellent travel photography, minimal design, striking typography, and great stories very well. Reading through the blog felt like I was flipping through stunning lifestyle books from great publishers like Kinfolk.
                    The content of the blog is also pretty unique, with a significant focus on aesthetic travel style, recommending cool boutique hotels, restaurants, and bars accompanied by great photography that makes you want to be there. Their Bangkok Travel Guide is, of course, of big interest to me since I was born and raised there, and I gotta tell ya, some of the places they recommended, I didn't even know existed!
                    If you are looking for a travel blog with top-notch content as well as extremely pleasing aesthetics, be sure to check out Roadbook.com. It doesn't get any better than this.

                <h2>Rojo Cangrejo</h2>
                <p>This is a travel blog I selected purely of its artistic style because the content is in Spanish but the design language of this blog is one of the most unique designs I have seen on a travel blog.
                Rojo Cangrejo's design consisted of a lot of blocks and lines laid out in a minimal way while relying on contrasty colors like turquoise and stunning photography to catch your attention and it works.
                Marta, the writer behind Roko Cangrejo is also an excellent photographer who is able to capture the little intimate moments we often experience while traveling. Her article about Sharpening Knives in the Japanese Town of Sakai is a great example of that. If you are looking for a uniquely designed travel blog, checking out Rojo Cangrejo is a no-brainer.
