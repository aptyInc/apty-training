            <h3>SMS Spam detection using NLP Techniques</h3>
            <p> With the rise of mobile communication, SMS spam detection has become essential to protect users from unsolicited and harmful messages. This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Preprocessing steps like tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming prepare the text, while features are extracted using methods like TF-IDF, Bag of Words, or embeddings such as Word2Vec.

                Machine learning models (e.g., Na√Øve Bayes, SVM) or deep learning methods (LSTMs, Transformers) are applied for classification. The system is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and F1-score, showing high effectiveness even on imbalanced datasets. This approach provides a scalable solution to enhance SMS security, with potential for real-time detection and multilingual support. </p>

            <h3>Implementation of digital filter using verilog HDL</h3>
            <p> In the context of Very Large Scale Integration technology, where addition is essential, digital filters are essential 
                elements. The performance of the Finite Impulse Response Filter is highly dependent on the speed of its multiplier unit, making 
                it stand out among the others. In order to improve the effectiveness of the FIR filter, we suggest using a Wallace tree multiplier. 
                This novel method offers improvements over conventional multipliers, with a decrease in latency being one of the main 
                advantages. Significant improvements in latency are obtained by using Xilinx tools and implementing this filter design in 
                Verilog HDL. The Wallace tree multiplier is perfect for FIR filter construction in low-voltage and low-power VLSI applications 
                since it has benefits like higher operating frequency and reduced power consumption. This development might improve the 
                effectiveness and performance of digital filters, especially in settings with limited resources, opening the way for more robust 
                VLSI systems. </p>
