### Terms and Conditions ### 
- [ ] I Accept losing points if my PR does not follow the best practices mentioned below, which will impact my overall performance in training

### HTML Best Practices ### 
- [ ] File Naming Convention:
- Follow consistent and descriptive naming (e.g., dashboard.html, user-profile.html).
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens instead of spaces.

- [ ] Page Title:
- Ensure the <title> tag is descriptive and aligns with the page content.
- Include meaningful keywords for SEO if applicable.

- [ ] Semantic Markup:
- Use appropriate tags like \<header>, \<footer>, \<section>, \<article> for better readability and accessibility.
- Accessibility Standards:
- Ensure the use of alt attributes for images and proper labels for form elements.
- Use ARIA roles where necessary.

- [ ] Validation:
- Ensure the code passes HTML validation tools without errors or warnings.
- Structure and Indentation:
- Maintain consistent indentation and proper nesting of tags.

- [ ] Attributes:
- Ensure all required attributes (e.g., src, href, type, etc.) are correctly used and not left empty.


### CSS Best Practices ### 
- [ ] File Organization:
- Use modular CSS files if applicable (e.g., base.css, layout.css, theme.css).
- Avoid inline styles unless absolutely necessary.

- [ ] Naming Conventions:
- Use meaningful class names following BEM or other conventions (e.g., block__element--modifier).

- [ ] Code Reusability:
- Avoid duplicate code; use classes or mixins for shared styles.

- [ ] Responsive Design:
- Ensure proper usage of media queries for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

- [ ] Performance Optimization:
- Minimize the use of unnecessary CSS selectors.
- Avoid overly specific selectors and ensure selectors are not overly deep (e.g., avoid #id .class1 .class2 p).

- [ ] Consistency:
- Follow consistent spacing, indentation, and use of units (rem/em vs. px).
- Maintain a single coding style (e.g., always use double or single quotes consistently).


### Javascript Best Practices ### 
- [ ] File Organization:
- Ensure scripts are modular and logically separated into files if needed.
- Avoid mixing inline JavaScript with HTML.

- [ ] Logic Optimization:
- Check for redundancy and ensure the code is optimized for performance.
- Avoid unnecessary API calls or DOM manipulations.

- [ ] Solution Approach:
- Confirm that the code solves the given problem efficiently.
- Consider scalability for future enhancements.

- [ ] Readability:
- Use clear variable and function names.
- Add comments for complex logic or algorithms.
 
- [ ] Error Handling:
- Ensure proper error handling for API calls or user input validation. 

- [ ] Code Quality:
- Check for potential bugs (e.g., missing await, mishandling of null/undefined values).
- Avoid unnecessary console.log statements in production code.

- [ ] Security:
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive data.
- Sanitize user input to prevent XSS and other vulnerabilities.

- [ ] Best Practices:
- Use const and let instead of var.
- Follow ES6+ standards where applicable.
