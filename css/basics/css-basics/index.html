    <p>Deadpool is a character appearing in American 
        comic books published by Marvel Comics. 
        Created by Fabian Nicieza and Rob Liefeld, 
        the character first appeared in New Mutants #98 (December 1990). 
        In his comic book appearances, Deadp is initially depicted 
        as a supervillain of the New Mutants and X-Force, though later stories 
        would portray him as an antihero. Deadpool is the alter ego of Wade Wilson, 
        a disfigured Canadian mercenary with superhuman regenerative healing abilities. 
        He is known for his tendency to joke incessantly and break the fourth wall for 
        humorous effect.</p>
