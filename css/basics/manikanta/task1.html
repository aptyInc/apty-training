    <p>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems are tools that help businesses manage and analyze customer interactions and data throughout the customer lifecycle. CRMs centralize information such as contact details, communication history, and purchase behaviors, enabling companies to offer more personalized services. They enhance customer satisfaction, improve sales strategies, and streamline workflows by automating repetitive tasks. CRMs also support collaboration across departments, providing a holistic view of customer needs. Popular CRM platforms like Salesforce, HubSpot, and Zoho help businesses build stronger relationships, increase customer retention, and ultimately drive growth.
