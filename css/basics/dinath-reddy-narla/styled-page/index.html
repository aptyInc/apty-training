        Jon Snow is a fictional character in the A Song of Ice and Fire series
        of epic fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its
        HBO television adaptation Game of Thrones, in which he is portrayed by
        Kit Harington. In the novels, he is a prominent point of view character.
        He is one of the most popular characters in the series, and The New York
        Times cites him as one of the author's finest creations.[1][2] Jon is a
        main character in the TV series, and his storyline in the season 5
        finale generated a strong reaction among viewers. Speculation about the
        character's parentage has also been a popular topic of discussion among
        fans of both the books and the TV series.
