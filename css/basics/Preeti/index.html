    <h1>The legend behind Gotokuji Temple</h1>
    <p>
      Gotokuji Temple, located in the Setagaya ward of Tokyo, is a Buddhist
      temple that is said to be the birthplace of the maneki-neko, or
      “luck-inviting cat figurine.” These small statues, which portray a cat
      sitting up and beckoning with its front paw, have become quite popular all
      over the world with cat-lovers. Although there are many different kinds of
      maneki-neko raising either their right or left paws, Gotokuji Temple
      specializes in the right-pawed version of this good-luck symbol. According
      to temple legend, in the early 17th century, Ii Naotaka, the second lord
      of the Omi-Hikone Domain, was caught in a sudden thunderstorm. A cat
      living at the temple invited him inside, providing shelter from the storm.
      In gratitude to the cat, Naotaka dedicated the temple to the Ii clan.
      After Naotaka's death, the temple was renamed Gotokuji, derived from his
      posthumous Buddhist name, “Kyushoin-den Gotokuten ei-daikoji.”The cat that
      created the opportunity for the temple to grow into a respected and
      important place was deified as the "Fortune-Inviting Kannon." This cat,
      later known for bringing good fortune, became known as "shou-fuku byou-ji"
      or "maneki-neko." Gotokuji Temple has since been filled with lucky cat
      figurines donated by worshippers, symbolizing the cat's enduring legacy of
      good luck.
