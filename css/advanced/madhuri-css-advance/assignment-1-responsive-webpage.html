        <p>This is grip and flex box example page. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts—either a row or a column. Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts—both rows and columns. </p>

        <h3>Flexbox</h3>
        <p>The flexible box module has been designed as a one-dimensional presentation model and as a method that can provide space distribution between interface elements and powerful alignment functions. When we describe the flexbox as one-dimensional, we describe the fact that flexbox processes layouts in one dimension at a time, as a row or column. This can be compared to the two-dimensional model of the CSS grid layout, which controls columns and rows together.</p>

        <h3>Gridbox</h3>
        <p>CSS Grid aligns items in columns and rows, allowing developers to easily control the rendering and appearance of large layouts and whole pages meant for the desktop, tablet, and smartphone displays. Items are placed inside the cells defined by the grid. Creating and defining the overall layouts remains the strong suit for CSS Grid.</p>
