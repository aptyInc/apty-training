                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language 
                    used to create and structure content on the web. It consists 
                    of elements and tags that define the structure of web pages, 
                    such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

                    JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic

                    tasks on the client side.
